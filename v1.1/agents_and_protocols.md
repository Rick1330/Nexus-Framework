- **Purpose**: To reliably transfer responsibility for a task, along with necessary context, from one agent to another.
- **Participants**: Sending Agent, Receiving Agent, Orchestration Engine.
- **Trigger**: Completion of a sub-task requiring subsequent action by another agent.
- **Message Formats**: `TaskHandoffRequest` (includes task ID, context bundle, required inputs, success criteria), `TaskHandoffAck`, `TaskHandoffReject`.

- **Success Criteria**: Receiving Agent sends `TaskHandoffAck`.
- **Error Handling**: Rejection triggers escalation or re-assignment by Orchestrator; timeouts trigger retries or failure escalation.
- **Guarantees**: Ensures receiving agent has necessary context; prevents task loss.

- **Success Criteria**: `FinalResolutionDecision` issued and accepted by conflicting agents.
- **Error Handling**: Failure to reach consensus triggers escalation to higher-level agent (e.g., Strategic Oversight) or Human Interface Layer.
