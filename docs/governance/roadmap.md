### 8. Versioning and Compatibility Framework
**Timeline**: Weeks 4-5
**Deliverables**:
- API versioning strategy
- Agent capability versioning system
- Memory schema evolution approach
- Workflow versioning and migration tools
- Backward compatibility guidelines

## Tier 3: Strategic Enhancements (Weeks 5-8)
*These items should be addressed before full-scale implementation but can be developed in parallel with early implementation phases.*

### 9. Knowledge Management System
**Timeline**: Weeks 5-6
**Deliverables**:
- Knowledge curation process documentation

## Implementation Dependencies and Critical Path

The roadmap follows these key dependencies:

1. **Critical Foundation** (Tier 1) must be completed before any implementation begins, as these components fundamentally shape the architecture.

2. **Critical Enhancements** (Tier 2) should be substantially complete before detailed implementation planning, though some implementation of core components can begin in parallel.

3. **Strategic Enhancements** (Tier 3) can be developed alongside early implementation phases but should be completed before full-scale development.

The critical path runs through:
- Testing Framework → Resilience Architecture → Resource Management → Agent Specialization → Implementation

## Resource Allocation Recommendation

To execute this roadmap efficiently, the following resource allocation is recommended:

- **Architecture Team**: 2-3 senior architects focused on Tier 1 items
- **Security Team**: 1-2 security specialists for security model and compliance framework
- **DevOps Team**: 1-2 specialists for operational readiness and resource management
- **AI/ML Team**: 2-3 specialists for agent specialization, testing, and evaluation frameworks

## Success Criteria

The pre-implementation refinement phase will be considered successful when:

1. All Tier 1 deliverables are complete and reviewed
2. At least 80% of Tier 2 deliverables are complete
3. A clear plan exists for completing remaining Tier 2 and Tier 3 items alongside early implementation
4. The architecture has been validated through targeted prototypes of high-risk components
5. All identified critical gaps have been addressed with concrete architectural solutions

## Continuous Refinement

This roadmap should be treated as a living document, with regular reviews and updates as new insights emerge. A weekly architecture review meeting is recommended to assess progress, identify new gaps, and adjust priorities as needed.
