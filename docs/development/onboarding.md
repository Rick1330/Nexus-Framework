Each layer has distinct responsibilities and interfaces, enabling modularity and separation of concerns. For a detailed breakdown of each layer and its components, refer to the [Codebase Overview](02_codebase_overview.md).

## Key Architectural Principles

As you develop for Nexus, keep these core principles in mind:

1. **Modularity**: All components should be independent modules with clear interfaces
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer and component has distinct responsibilities
3. **Hierarchical Orchestration**: Coordination occurs at multiple levels with clear delegation
4. **Standardized Interfaces**: All components communicate through standardized protocols
5. **Extensibility**: The system is designed to be extended with new capabilities
6. **Observability**: All system activities must be observable and traceable
7. **Resilience**: The system must recover from failures and adapt to changing conditions
8. **Security by Design**: Security is integrated at all levels of the architecture

2. **Refinement**: Issues are refined with acceptance criteria and technical details
3. **Assignment**: Issues are assigned during sprint planning or ad-hoc for critical fixes
4. **Implementation**: Developer implements the solution following our [Style & Design Principles](03_style_and_design_principles.md)
5. **Review**: Code is reviewed by at least two team members
6. **Testing**: Automated tests and manual verification ensure quality
7. **Merge**: Approved changes are merged to the appropriate branch
8. **Deployment**: Changes flow through our CI/CD pipeline to staging and production environments

### Branch Strategy

We follow a modified GitFlow workflow:
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for feature development
- `feature/*`: Individual feature branches
- `release/*`: Release candidate branches
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes for production

For detailed guidelines, see the [Collaboration Protocols](04_collaboration_protocols.md).
