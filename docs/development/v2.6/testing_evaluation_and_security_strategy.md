# Nexus Framework v2.6: Testing, Evaluation, and Security Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive testing, evaluation, and security strategy for Nexus Framework v2.6. The strategy ensures that all components meet quality standards, function correctly in isolation and integration, perform efficiently at scale, and maintain robust security throughout the development lifecycle.

The strategy is designed to support distributed development across specialized Manus accounts while maintaining system-wide coherence, quality, and security. It establishes clear testing responsibilities, evaluation criteria, and security practices for each phase and component, with specific guidance for cross-component validation and system-wide assessment.

## Strategy Design Principles

The testing, evaluation, and security strategy adheres to the following core principles:

1. **Shift Left**: Testing, evaluation, and security begin at the earliest stages of development
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All components and integrations are thoroughly tested
3. **Automation First**: Automated testing is prioritized for consistency and efficiency
4. **Risk-Based Approach**: Testing and security efforts are prioritized based on risk
5. **Continuous Validation**: Testing and security assessment occur throughout the development lifecycle
6. **Clear Ownership**: Testing and security responsibilities are clearly assigned
7. **Layered Defense**: Security is implemented in multiple layers with defense in depth
8. **Evidence-Based Evaluation**: Evaluation is based on objective evidence and metrics
