name: Vector Database Optimization - Core Practices
use_when: When designing, implementing, or optimizing vector databases for AI applications, embeddings storage, or similarity search.
content: |
  Key practices for vector database optimization:
  1.  **Vector Representation**: Choose appropriate embedding models, standardize dimensions, use normalization, and consider quantization.
  2.  **Index Selection**: Select optimal index types (HNSW, IVF, FLAT) based on workload, tune parameters, and benchmark configurations.
  3.  **Query Optimization**: Implement vector caching, approximate nearest neighbor search, hybrid search, and metadata filtering.
  4.  **Data Organization**: Design proper collections/tables, use sharding, partitioning, and metadata for efficient filtering.
  5.  **Performance Tuning**: Configure memory, use SSDs, implement caching, batch processing, and monitor query latency.
  6.  **Scaling Strategies**: Implement horizontal scaling, read replicas, load balancing, and distributed deployments.
  7.  **Retrieval Strategies**: Use semantic chunking, hierarchical retrieval, re-ranking, and hybrid retrieval.
  8.  **Monitoring & Maintenance**: Track performance metrics, evaluate recall/precision, and perform regular index maintenance.
  9.  **Integration Patterns**: Use standardized APIs, proper error handling, connection pooling, and asynchronous operations.
  10. **Security Considerations**: Implement access controls, encryption, network security, and secure credential management.
  Apply these practices for high-performance, scalable, and reliable vector database solutions.
