name: Agent Reasoning System Design - Core Principles
use_when: When designing, implementing, or optimizing reasoning systems for AI agents, cognitive architectures, or decision-making components.
content: |
  Key design principles for agent reasoning systems:
  1.  **Reasoning Architecture**: Implement layered, modular design with clear separation of knowledge and processes; design for transparency and graceful degradation.
  2.  **Knowledge Representation**: Use appropriate formats (semantic networks, frames, rules, probabilistic models); design for ontology, evolution, and efficient retrieval.
  3.  **Reasoning Strategies**: Implement diverse methods (deductive, inductive, abductive, analogical); use chain-of-thought, tree-of-thought, and case-based reasoning.
  4.  **Decision Making**: Implement utility-based, multi-criteria analysis; handle uncertainty; design for explainable and ethical decisions.
  5.  **Planning & Problem Solving**: Use hierarchical task networks, goal decomposition, means-end analysis; design for replanning and contingency.
  6.  **Learning Integration**: Integrate experience-based, reinforcement, transfer, and meta-learning; design for continuous learning.
  7.  **Context Management**: Design for proper context representation, tracking, and sensitive reasoning; use working memory and context switching.
  8.  **Reasoning Optimization**: Implement anytime algorithms, progressive refinement, resource-aware reasoning, caching, and parallel processing.
  9.  **Evaluation & Verification**: Design for transparency, self-verification, formal verification, consistency checking, and performance metrics.
  10. **Integration with Other Systems**: Design clean interfaces, integrate with knowledge bases, use standardized formats, and handle errors.
  Apply these principles for effective, explainable, and reliable cognitive capabilities.
