  Core QA metrics and KPIs:
  1.  **Code Quality Metrics**: Cyclomatic complexity, code coverage, duplicate code, technical debt ratio, static analysis violations, dependency freshness.
  2.  **Testing Effectiveness Metrics**: Defect detection percentage, test case effectiveness, requirements coverage, mutation score, test flakiness rate, automated test percentage.
  3.  **Defect Metrics**: Defect density, severity distribution, defect age, resolution time, escape rate, injection rate, regression rate, root cause analysis.
  4.  **Performance Metrics**: Response time, throughput, error rate, CPU/memory utilization, database query performance, page load time, API latency.
  5.  **Security Metrics**: Vulnerability density, OWASP Top 10 coverage, security defect age, dependency vulnerability count, security test coverage.
  6.  **User Experience Metrics**: Usability test success rate, user error rate, user satisfaction, accessibility compliance, feature adoption, task completion time.
  7.  **Process Metrics**: Build/deployment success rate, time to deploy, code review coverage/depth, time to merge, lead time, MTTR.
  8.  **Documentation Metrics**: Coverage, freshness, quality score, feedback, usage, example coverage, build success, broken links.
  9.  **Team Metrics**: Velocity consistency, sprint completion, estimation accuracy, knowledge distribution, team satisfaction, onboarding time.
  10. **Quality Dashboard Implementation**: Real-time dashboards, trend visualization, alerting, drill-down capabilities, consistent visualization.
  Apply these practices for comprehensive quality monitoring and continuous improvement.
