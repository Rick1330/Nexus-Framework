  Core practices for test automation strategy:
  1.  **Test Pyramid**: Implement a balanced pyramid (70% Unit, 20% Integration, 10% E2E); ensure isolation and use appropriate tools for each level.
  2.  **Framework Design**: Use Page Object Model (UI), Service Objects (API), proper abstraction, test data management, and consistent assertions.
  3.  **Test Data Management**: Implement test data factories, database seeding, proper isolation, and data cleanup after tests.
  4.  **Continuous Testing**: Integrate tests into CI/CD; implement parallelization, test splitting, and result reporting for fast feedback.
  5.  **API Testing**: Implement contract testing, schema validation, API mocking, API versioning in tests, and performance testing.
  6.  **UI Testing**: Implement visual testing, resilient selector strategies, proper wait mechanisms, responsive testing, and accessibility testing.
  7.  **Performance Testing**: Implement load, stress, and endurance testing; design for performance regression detection and realistic user simulation.
  8.  **Security Testing Automation**: Implement SAST/DAST integration, dependency scanning, security regression testing, and automated penetration testing.
  9.  **Test Reporting & Analytics**: Implement comprehensive dashboards, trend analysis, test coverage visualization, and failure analysis.
  10. **Test Maintenance**: Implement test code reviews, proper documentation, refactoring practices, and version control for test code.
  Apply these practices for comprehensive quality assurance and reliable system behavior.
