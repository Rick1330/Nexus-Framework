  Core practices for project coordination:
  1.  **Distributed Team Coordination**: Implement hub-and-spoke model; use daily syncs, weekly integration reviews, and asynchronous communication.
  2.  **Work Breakdown Structure**: Implement hierarchical WBS with clear ownership; use consistent task granularity (1-3 days); manage dependencies.
  3.  **Progress Tracking**: Implement burndown/burnup charts, cumulative flow diagrams, milestone tracking, and automated reporting.
  4.  **Risk Management**: Implement proactive identification, assessment (likelihood x impact), mitigation planning, and regular reviews.
  5.  **Dependency Management**: Visualize dependencies; classify (hard/soft); perform critical path analysis; minimize dependencies.
  6.  **Decision Management**: Implement structured decision-making; use decision logs; ensure proper communication and escalation.
  7.  **Meeting Management**: Implement structured templates, clear agendas, efficient facilitation, and action item tracking.
  8.  **Documentation Management**: Implement centralized repository, consistent templates, version control, and accessibility.
  9.  **Status Reporting**: Implement multi-level reporting; use consistent templates; design for exception-based reporting and visual indicators.
  10. **Continuous Improvement**: Implement regular retrospectives, structured improvement tracking, and knowledge sharing.
  Apply these practices for effective collaboration, transparency, and successful project delivery.
