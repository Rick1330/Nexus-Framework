  Adapting agile methodologies for multi-agent projects:
  1.  **Scaled Agile Frameworks (SAFe/LeSS)**: Adopt frameworks designed for large-scale agile development to coordinate multiple agent teams. Focus on Program Increments (PIs) for alignment and synchronized sprints.
  2.  **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Foster collaboration through regular Scrum of Scrums, communities of practice, and shared communication channels. Emphasize transparent information sharing.
  3.  **Shared Definition of Done**: Establish a common 


definition of done across all agent teams to ensure consistent quality and integration readiness.
  4.  **Continuous Integration & Delivery**: Implement CI/CD pipelines that integrate code and artifacts from all agent teams frequently, enabling rapid feedback and early detection of integration issues.
  5.  **Adaptive Planning**: Embrace iterative and adaptive planning cycles. Use short sprints and frequent reviews to allow for adjustments based on new information or changes in agent capabilities.
  6.  **Transparent Backlogs**: Maintain a transparent, prioritized backlog accessible to all agent teams. Clearly define dependencies between tasks and assign ownership.
  7.  **Risk Management**: Proactively identify and mitigate risks associated with multi-agent coordination, such as communication overhead, integration complexities, and knowledge silos.
  8.  **Feedback Loops**: Establish continuous feedback loops at all levels (individual agent, team, program) to enable rapid learning and improvement.
  9.  **Metrics & Reporting**: Define relevant metrics (e.g., velocity, lead time, defect escape rate) to track progress and quality across the multi-agent project. Use dashboards for visibility.
  10. **Facilitation & Coaching**: Provide dedicated agile coaches or facilitators to guide agent teams, resolve impediments, and promote agile principles throughout the project.
  Apply these agile adaptations to effectively manage complex multi-agent development projects.
