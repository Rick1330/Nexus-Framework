  Core UI/UX design principles:
  1.  **Visual Hierarchy**: Organize elements by importance (size, color, spacing); guide user attention; use consistent headings and whitespace.
  2.  **Consistency**: Maintain uniform color schemes, typography, spacing, interaction patterns, and terminology across the application.
  3.  **Accessibility**: Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA; ensure sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigability, text alternatives, and screen reader compatibility.
  4.  **Responsive Design**: Implement mobile-first approach; use flexible grids; design for touch targets; test on multiple devices.
  5.  **User Feedback**: Provide immediate feedback (loading indicators, error messages, success confirmations, progress indicators).
  6.  **Information Architecture**: Organize content logically; use clear labels for navigation; implement breadcrumbs and search functionality.
  7.  **Interaction Design**: Design intuitive, predictable interactions; minimize user effort; provide clear affordances; design for error prevention.
  8.  **Performance Perception**: Optimize perceived performance with skeleton screens, progressive loading, optimistic UI, and smooth transitions.
  9.  **Data Visualization**: Choose appropriate chart types; use clear labels/legends; employ color effectively; provide interactive elements.
  10. **Cognitive Load Management**: Minimize memory load; break complex tasks; use recognition over recall; provide clear defaults.
  Apply these principles for usable, accessible, and cohesive user experiences.
