  Core design patterns for React components:
  1.  **Component Composition**: Create small, focused components; compose complex UIs; use `children` props, compound components, and render props.
  2.  **State Management**: Use local state, Zustand for global state, React Query for server state, Context for shared state, and reducers for complex logic.
  3.  **Performance Optimization**: Use `React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, virtualization, code splitting, and proper dependency arrays.
  4.  **Styling Patterns**: Use TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui for consistency, CSS variables for theming, and responsive design.
  5.  **Form Handling**: Use React Hook Form for state, Zod for validation, controlled components, and proper submission handling.
  6.  **Data Fetching**: Use React Query for fetching/caching, implement loading/error states, optimistic updates, and prefetching.
  7.  **Routing Patterns**: Use Next.js App Router, nested routes, dynamic routes, route guards, and loading states.
  8.  **Accessibility**: Use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, focus management, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.
  9.  **Testing Patterns**: Use React Testing Library for components, Jest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E, and MSW for mocking.
  10. **Error Handling**: Use error boundaries, fallback UI, try/catch for async ops, global error handling, and toast notifications.
  Apply these patterns for maintainable, performant, and accessible React applications.
