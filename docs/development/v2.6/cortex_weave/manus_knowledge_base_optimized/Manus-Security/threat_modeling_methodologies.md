  Key threat modeling methodologies:
  1.  **STRIDE**: A widely used methodology for classifying threats based on six categories: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. Helps in systematically identifying potential vulnerabilities.
  2.  **DREAD**: A risk assessment model used to quantify the severity of identified threats. It evaluates threats based on Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, and Discoverability. (Often used in conjunction with STRIDE).
  3.  **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)**: A seven-step, risk-centric methodology that aims to provide a dynamic threat identification, enumeration, and scoring process. It aligns business objectives with technical requirements and considers the attacker's perspective.
  4.  **LINDDUN**: A privacy-specific threat modeling methodology that focuses on identifying privacy threats. It uses a set of privacy-related threat categories: Linkability, Identifiability, Non-repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure of information, Unawareness, and Non-compliance.
  5.  **Attack Trees**: A formal, hierarchical diagramming method for representing attacks against a system. It breaks down high-level attacks into more detailed sub-attacks, helping to identify all possible attack paths.
  6.  **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)**: A standardized method for assessing the severity of software vulnerabilities. It provides a numerical score reflecting the severity and helps prioritize remediation efforts.
  7.  **OWASP Top 10**: A regularly updated list of the most critical web application security risks. While not a methodology itself, it serves as a valuable checklist for common threats during threat modeling.
  8.  **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**: Visual representations of how data moves through a system. Used in threat modeling to identify trust boundaries, data stores, and processes that might be vulnerable.
  9.  **Security Cards**: A gamified approach to threat modeling, using a deck of cards to prompt discussions and identify threats. Encourages creative thinking and collaboration among team members.
  10. **OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation)**: A self-directed threat modeling method that focuses on organizational risk. It helps organizations identify information assets, threats to those assets, and vulnerabilities.
  Apply these methodologies to systematically identify, analyze, and mitigate security threats throughout the software development lifecycle.
