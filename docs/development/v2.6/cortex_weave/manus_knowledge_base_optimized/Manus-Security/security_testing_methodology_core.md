name: Security Testing Methodology - Core
use_when: When designing, implementing, or reviewing security testing plans, vulnerability assessments, or penetration testing activities.

  Core security testing methodologies:
  1.  **Security Testing Strategy**: Layered approach (automated/manual); integrate throughout SDLC; risk-based prioritization; cover OWASP Top 10/SANS 25.
  2.  **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Integrate into CI/CD; use custom rules; implement incremental scanning and false positive management.
  3.  **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Implement automated DAST in deployment pipeline; use authenticated/unauthenticated scanning; define proper scope.
  4.  **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)**: Implement for dev/test environments; use runtime instrumentation; design for developer feedback integration.
  5.  **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular tests (black/gray/white box); implement proper scoping, reporting, and remediation tracking.
  6.  **Vulnerability Management**: Structured process for classification, prioritization, SLAs, verification, and trending.
  7.  **Security Code Review**: Security-focused reviews; use checklists; implement pair review for critical code; share knowledge.
  8.  **API Security Testing**: Comprehensive testing of API security controls; use fuzzing, authentication/authorization testing, and contract-based security.
  9.  **Infrastructure Security Testing**: Regular vulnerability scanning; configuration compliance; container security scanning; cloud security posture assessment.
  10. **Security Test Automation**: Implement automation framework; use orchestration; proper reporting; security test metrics/KPIs; continuous testing.
  Apply these methodologies for comprehensive security validation and vulnerability management.
