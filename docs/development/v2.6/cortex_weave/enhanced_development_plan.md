# Nexus Framework v2.6: Enhanced Development Plan with Execution Framework

## Executive Summary

This enhanced development plan expands the original phase > sub-phase > task > account structure with comprehensive execution frameworks, practical tools, and actionable protocols. By integrating supporting elements directly into the development workflow, this plan ensures that the distributed development approach is not only well-structured but also immediately executable.

The plan maintains the core structure of 6 major phases, 24 sub-phases, and 192 specific tasks, while adding practical implementation guidance, workflow automation, and collaboration mechanisms to ensure smooth execution across the 8 specialized Manus accounts.
