## Implementation Guidelines

To effectively implement this detailed development plan:

1. **Task Tracking**: Use a project management tool (e.g., GitHub Projects, Jira) to track tasks, assign them to accounts, and monitor progress.

2. **Daily Coordination**: Hold brief daily coordination meetings between account representatives to discuss progress, blockers, and integration points.

3. **Weekly Reviews**: Conduct weekly reviews of completed tasks, validate deliverables against requirements, and adjust the plan as needed.

4. **Documentation First**: For each task, begin by documenting the design and approach before implementation to ensure alignment.

5. **Continuous Integration**: Integrate components as they are completed rather than waiting for entire sub-phases to finish.

6. **Testing Automation**: Automate testing for all components to ensure quality and enable continuous validation.

7. **Knowledge Sharing**: Establish mechanisms for sharing knowledge and lessons learned between specialized accounts.

## Conclusion

This detailed task breakdown provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing Nexus Framework v2.6 using specialized Manus accounts. By clearly defining tasks, responsibilities, and deliverables at a granular level, this plan enables efficient distributed development while maintaining system coherence and quality.

The phase > sub-phase > task > account structure ensures clear ownership, facilitates tracking, and supports effective coordination across the development process. This approach balances the benefits of specialization with the need for integration, resulting in a high-quality, coherent system implementation.
