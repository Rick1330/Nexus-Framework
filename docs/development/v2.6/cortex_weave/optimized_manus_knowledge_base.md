This document provides an optimized and expanded set of custom knowledge entries for each specialized Manus account involved in the Cortex Weave project. These entries are designed to be concise, actionable, and formatted specifically for seamless integration into the Manus system, ensuring each agent has the precise information needed to perform its role effectively.

Each knowledge entry follows the standard Manus format:

```
name: [Unique Name of Knowledge Entry]
use_when: [Contextual trigger for when Manus should use this knowledge]
content: [The actual knowledge or instruction]
```

## 1. Manus-Architect Knowledge Base

The Manus-Architect is responsible for defining and maintaining the overall system architecture, ensuring modularity, scalability, and adherence to design principles. Their knowledge base focuses on high-level design patterns, architectural decision-making, and system-wide consistency.

### 1.1 Core Architectural Principles

These entries guide the Architect in applying fundamental architectural concepts.

```
name: Layered Architecture Principle
use_when: When designing system structure or reviewing component placement.
content: Design systems with distinct, well-defined layers (e.g., Presentation, Application, Domain, Infrastructure) to promote separation of concerns, reduce coupling, and enhance maintainability. Each layer should only interact with the layers immediately below it.
```

```
name: Modularity Principle
use_when: When breaking down large systems into smaller, manageable components or services.
content: Promote modularity by designing components with high cohesion (single responsibility) and low coupling (minimal dependencies on other components). Modules should be independently deployable and testable.
```

```
name: Interface Segregation Principle
use_when: When defining interfaces between components or services.
content: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Create small, role-specific interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones to reduce unnecessary dependencies and improve flexibility.
```

```
name: Dependency Inversion Principle
use_when: When designing interactions between high-level and low-level modules.
content: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This promotes flexible, testable, and maintainable code.
```

```
name: Composition Over Inheritance
use_when: When choosing between inheritance and composition for code reuse.
content: Favor composition (building complex objects from simpler ones) over inheritance (deriving new classes from existing ones) to achieve greater flexibility, reduce tight coupling, and avoid the 


fragility of inheritance hierarchies.
```

```
name: Observability by Design
use_when: When designing new features or components, especially for distributed systems.
content: Incorporate logging, metrics, and tracing from the outset. Ensure components emit rich, structured logs, expose relevant metrics, and propagate trace contexts to enable effective monitoring, debugging, and performance analysis in production.
```

```
name: Graceful Degradation Strategy
use_when: When designing for fault tolerance and resilience in critical systems.
content: Implement mechanisms that allow the system to continue operating, albeit with reduced functionality, when certain components fail. Prioritize core functionalities and provide fallback options or informative error messages for non-essential features.
```

```
name: Horizontal Scalability Principle
use_when: When designing services or components that need to handle increasing load.
content: Design components to be stateless and easily replicable across multiple instances. Avoid sticky sessions and rely on external, scalable data stores. This allows scaling by adding more machines rather than increasing the capacity of a single machine.
```

### 2.1 API Design Best Practices

These entries guide the Backend agent in creating well-structured and maintainable APIs.

```
name: RESTful Resource Modeling

```

```
name: HTTP Status Codes Usage
use_when: When defining API responses for various scenarios (success, error, redirection).
content: Use appropriate HTTP status codes to convey the outcome of an API request. 2xx for success, 3xx for redirection, 4xx for client errors, and 5xx for server errors. Provide clear error messages in the response body for 4xx/5xx.
```

```
name: Idempotent API Design
use_when: When designing APIs for operations that might be retried (e.g., payment processing).
content: Design PUT, DELETE, and safe POST operations to be idempotent. This means that making the same request multiple times has the same effect as making it once, preventing unintended side effects from retries.
```

```
name: Versioning APIs
use_when: When making breaking changes to an API or releasing new API features.
content: Implement API versioning (e.g., via URL, header, or query parameter) to allow clients to continue using older versions while new versions are introduced. Plan for deprecation and migration paths.
```

```
name: Secure API Practices
use_when: When implementing API authentication, authorization, and data handling.

```
name: Message Queues for Asynchronous Tasks
use_when: When offloading long-running operations from the main request-response cycle.

```

```
name: Event-Driven Architecture
use_when: When designing systems that react to changes or events.
content: Implement event-driven patterns where services communicate by publishing and subscribing to events. This promotes loose coupling, scalability, and real-time responsiveness. Use an event broker for reliable event delivery.
```

```
name: Circuit Breaker Pattern
use_when: When integrating with external services or potentially unreliable dependencies.

```

```
name: Higher-Order Components (HOCs)
use_when: When reusing component logic across multiple components without inheritance.
content: Use HOCs to wrap components and inject props or behavior. This is a powerful pattern for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, data fetching, or logging. Prefer React Hooks in modern React.
```

```

```

```
name: Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
use_when: When optimizing bundle size and initial page load time.
