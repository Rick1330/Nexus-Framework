When designing UI/UX for Nexus Framework v2.6, adhere to these principles:

1. **Visual Hierarchy**:
   - Organize elements by importance using size, color, and spacing
   - Guide users' attention to primary actions
   - Use consistent heading levels (H1, H2, H3)
   - Implement proper whitespace to create visual breathing room
   - Group related elements visually
   - Use contrast to highlight important information
   - Maintain balanced layouts with proper alignment

2. **Consistency**:
   - Use consistent color schemes from the design system
   - Maintain uniform typography across the application
   - Implement consistent spacing and sizing
   - Use the same interaction patterns throughout
   - Maintain consistent iconography and visual language
   - Ensure terminology consistency across all interfaces
   - Follow platform conventions where appropriate

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all interfaces
   - Use sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for text)
   - Ensure keyboard navigability for all interactions
   - Provide text alternatives for non-text content
   - Design for screen reader compatibility
   - Support text resizing up to 200% without loss of content
   - Ensure focus indicators are clearly visible

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Implement mobile-first design approach
   - Use flexible grid layouts that adapt to screen size
   - Design for touch targets (minimum 44x44px)
   - Test on multiple device sizes and orientations
   - Implement appropriate breakpoints for layout changes
   - Ensure content readability at all screen sizes
   - Optimize performance for mobile devices

5. **User Feedback**:
   - Provide immediate feedback for all user actions
   - Use appropriate loading indicators for async operations
   - Implement clear error messages with recovery paths
   - Use success confirmations for completed actions
   - Provide progress indicators for multi-step processes
   - Use microinteractions to enhance engagement
   - Implement toast notifications for system messages

6. **Information Architecture**:
   - Organize content in a logical, intuitive structure
   - Use clear, descriptive labels for navigation
   - Implement breadcrumbs for deep hierarchies
   - Provide clear wayfinding cues
   - Use progressive disclosure for complex information
   - Implement search functionality for large content sets
   - Use appropriate information density for the context

7. **Interaction Design**:
   - Design intuitive, predictable interactions
   - Minimize user effort for common tasks
   - Implement appropriate input methods for different data types
   - Use familiar interaction patterns
   - Provide clear affordances for interactive elements
   - Design for error prevention
   - Support undo/redo for destructive actions

8. **Performance Perception**:
   - Optimize perceived performance with skeleton screens
   - Implement progressive loading for large content
   - Use optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
   - Preload anticipated content
   - Minimize layout shifts during loading
   - Implement smooth transitions between states
   - Prioritize above-the-fold content loading

9. **Data Visualization**:
   - Choose appropriate chart types for different data
   - Use clear labels and legends
   - Implement consistent scales and axes
   - Use color effectively to convey meaning
   - Provide interactive elements for data exploration
   - Design for data density appropriate to the user
   - Include proper context for interpretation

10. **Cognitive Load Management**:
    - Minimize required user memory load
    - Break complex tasks into manageable steps
    - Use recognition over recall where possible
    - Provide clear defaults for common scenarios
    - Implement progressive disclosure for complex features
    - Use familiar patterns and metaphors
    - Maintain focused, distraction-free interfaces

Apply these principles consistently across all user interfaces to ensure usability, accessibility, and a cohesive user experience.
