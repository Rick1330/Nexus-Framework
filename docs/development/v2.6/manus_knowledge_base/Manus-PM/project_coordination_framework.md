When implementing project coordination for Nexus Framework v2.6, follow these framework practices:

1. **Distributed Team Coordination**:
   - Implement a hub-and-spoke coordination model with clear roles
   - Use daily synchronization meetings with focused agendas
   - Implement weekly integration reviews for cross-team alignment
   - Design for asynchronous communication with proper documentation
   - Use centralized project dashboards for visibility
   - Implement clear escalation paths for blockers
   - Design for time zone appropriate communication windows
   - Document team dependencies and interfaces

2. **Work Breakdown Structure**:
   - Implement hierarchical work breakdown with clear ownership
   - Use consistent task granularity (1-3 day tasks)
   - Implement proper dependency management between tasks
   - Design for parallel work streams where possible
   - Use clear acceptance criteria for all tasks
   - Implement proper estimation techniques (story points, t-shirt sizing)
   - Design for balanced workload across teams
   - Document critical path and bottleneck analysis

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Implement burndown/burnup charts for sprint progress
   - Use cumulative flow diagrams for workflow visualization
   - Implement milestone tracking with clear definitions
   - Design for automated progress reporting
   - Use velocity tracking for team capacity planning
   - Implement earned value management for complex projects
   - Design for variance analysis and forecasting
   - Document progress metrics and reporting cadence

4. **Risk Management**:
   - Implement proactive risk identification processes
   - Use risk assessment matrix (likelihood x impact)
   - Implement risk mitigation planning
   - Design for regular risk review cadence
   - Use risk registers with clear ownership
   - Implement contingency planning for high-impact risks
   - Design for risk-adjusted schedules
   - Document risk management procedures and responsibilities

5. **Dependency Management**:
   - Implement dependency visualization with directed graphs
   - Use dependency classification (hard vs. soft dependencies)
   - Implement critical path analysis
   - Design for dependency minimization
   - Use buffer management for dependency risks
   - Implement cross-team dependency agreements
   - Design for dependency tracking and alerting
   - Document dependency resolution procedures

6. **Decision Management**:
   - Implement structured decision-making framework (RACI matrix)
   - Use decision logs with context and rationale
   - Implement proper decision communication
   - Design for appropriate decision escalation
   - Use timeboxed decision processes
   - Implement decision review for critical choices
   - Design for decision transparency
   - Document decision-making authority and processes

7. **Meeting Management**:
   - Implement structured meeting templates for different purposes
   - Use clear agendas distributed in advance
   - Implement proper meeting facilitation techniques
   - Design for efficient time management
   - Use action item tracking with clear ownership
   - Implement meeting-free focus time blocks
   - Design for meeting effectiveness metrics
   - Document meeting cadence and participation requirements

8. **Documentation Management**:
   - Implement centralized documentation repository
   - Use consistent documentation templates
   - Implement proper version control for documents
   - Design for documentation accessibility
   - Use documentation reviews for quality
   - Implement documentation update cadence
   - Design for documentation search and discovery
   - Document information architecture and organization

9. **Status Reporting**:
   - Implement multi-level status reporting (executive, management, team)
   - Use consistent status report templates
   - Implement automated data collection where possible
   - Design for exception-based reporting
   - Use visual status indicators (red/amber/green)
   - Implement trend analysis in status reports
   - Design for actionable status information
   - Document reporting schedule and distribution

10. **Continuous Improvement**:
    - Implement regular retrospectives at multiple levels
    - Use structured improvement tracking
    - Implement metrics for process effectiveness
    - Design for knowledge sharing across teams
    - Use blameless postmortems for issues
    - Implement improvement experiments
    - Design for feedback collection and analysis
    - Document lessons learned and best practices

Apply these framework practices consistently across all project coordination activities to ensure effective collaboration, transparency, and successful delivery.
