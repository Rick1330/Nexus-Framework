name: Nexus v2.6 Architectural Principles
use_when: When making architectural decisions, reviewing component designs, or evaluating implementation approaches.
content: 
The Nexus Framework v2.6 architecture adheres to the following core principles:

1. **Layered Architecture**: The system is organized into distinct layers (Interface, Orchestration, Agent, Cognitive, Integration) with clear responsibilities and boundaries.

2. **Modularity**: Components are designed as self-contained modules with well-defined interfaces, enabling independent development and testing.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility with minimal overlap with other components.

4. **Explicit Interfaces**: All component interactions occur through explicitly defined interfaces, ensuring loose coupling and facilitating integration.

5. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions.

6. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Functionality is extended through composition rather than inheritance hierarchies.

7. **Defense in Depth**: Security is implemented at multiple layers with overlapping controls.

8. **Fail Secure**: System components fail in a secure state, preserving data integrity and confidentiality.

9. **Observability by Design**: All components provide comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing capabilities.

10. **Graceful Degradation**: The system maintains core functionality when components or dependencies fail.

11. **Horizontal Scalability**: Components are designed to scale horizontally through stateless design and distributed processing.

12. **Eventual Consistency**: The system prioritizes availability and partition tolerance, accepting eventual consistency where appropriate.

These principles must be applied consistently across all architectural decisions and implementations to ensure system coherence, quality, and maintainability.
