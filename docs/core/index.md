# Core Components

This section provides detailed documentation for the core components of the Nexus Framework v2.3, including:

- **Agents**: The specialized agent system that powers intelligent operations
- **Orchestration**: The workflow and coordination engine that manages agent interactions
- **Memory**: The sophisticated memory and knowledge management system
- **Planning**: The strategic and tactical planning components
- **Tools**: The tool registry and execution framework

## Subsystems

### [Agents](/docs/core/agents/)
Documentation for the agent subsystem, including agent specialization, roles, and capabilities.

### [Orchestration](/docs/core/orchestration/)
Documentation for the orchestration subsystem, including workflow management, task scheduling, and failure recovery.

### [Memory](/docs/core/memory/)
Documentation for the memory subsystem, including vector storage, knowledge graph, and context management.

### [Planning](/docs/core/planning/)
Documentation for the planning subsystem, including strategic planning and task decomposition.

### [Tools](/docs/core/tools/)
Documentation for the tools subsystem, including tool registry, execution, and custom tool development.

## Implementation Details

The core components are implemented in the `src/core/` directory, with a modular architecture that enables clean separation of concerns while maintaining tight integration between subsystems.

Each core component follows these design principles:
- Clear interfaces and contracts
- Dependency injection for flexible configuration
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Detailed logging and observability
