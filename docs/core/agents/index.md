# Agents

This section provides detailed documentation for the agent subsystem of the Nexus Framework v2.3, including agent specialization, roles, and capabilities.

## Overview

The agent subsystem is the core intelligence layer of the Nexus Framework, providing specialized agents with domain-specific capabilities that can collaborate to solve complex problems. The agent architecture follows a hierarchical organization with clear roles, responsibilities, and communication channels.

## Key Components

### [Agent Specialization](/docs/core/agents/specialization.md)
Documentation for the agent specialization framework, including capability-based agent architecture and specialization training methods.

### [Agent Roles](/docs/core/agents/roles.md)
Documentation for agent roles and responsibilities, including the protocols for inter-agent communication and collaboration.

## Base Agent Architecture

All agents in the Nexus Framework inherit from a common base agent architecture that provides:

- Standard interfaces for communication
- Memory access and context management
- Tool usage capabilities
- Planning and reasoning frameworks
- Observability and logging

## Implementation Details

The agent subsystem is implemented in the `src/core/agents/` directory, with a modular architecture that enables easy extension and customization of agent capabilities.
