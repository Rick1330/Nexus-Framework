# Resilience and Failure Recovery Architecture

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive resilience and failure recovery architecture for the Nexus Framework v2.3, addressing the critical need for robust handling of failures in distributed multi-agent workflows. While resilience has been mentioned as a principle in previous documentation, this architecture provides concrete mechanisms, patterns, and implementation guidelines to ensure system reliability even in the face of partial failures, network issues, or resource constraints.

## Core Resilience Challenges in Multi-Agent Systems

1. **Distributed Workflow Failures**: Long-running workflows spanning multiple agents may experience partial failures
2. **External Dependency Failures**: Integrations with external tools and services introduce failure points
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Compute, memory, or token quota exhaustion during operation
4. **LLM Service Disruptions**: Underlying LLM service availability or performance issues
5. **State Inconsistency**: Partial updates leading to inconsistent system state
6. **Cascading Failures**: Failures that propagate through the system affecting multiple components

## Resilience Architecture Overview

The resilience architecture is built on five interconnected pillars:

### 1. Failure Detection

**Purpose**: Quickly and accurately identify failures across the system

**Key Components**:
- **Health Monitoring System**: Continuous monitoring of all system components
- **Failure Classification Framework**: Categorization of failures by type, severity, and impact
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identification of unusual patterns that may indicate impending failures
- **Dependency Health Checks**: Proactive verification of external dependencies

**Implementation Patterns**:
- Regular heartbeat checks for all agents and services
- Timeout mechanisms for all operations with appropriate thresholds
- Structured logging of all errors with contextual information
- Synthetic transaction monitoring for end-to-end verification

### 2. Failure Isolation

**Purpose**: Contain failures to prevent cascading effects throughout the system

**Key Components**:
- **Circuit Breaker Implementation**: Prevent repeated calls to failing components
- **Bulkhead Pattern**: Isolate critical system components from each other
- **Resource Quotas**: Limit resource consumption to prevent system-wide impact
- **Failure Scope Definition**: Clear boundaries for failure propagation

**Implementation Patterns**:
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, reset_timeout=60):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.reset_timeout = reset_timeout
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF-OPEN
        
    def execute(self, function, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.reset_timeout:
                self.state = "HALF-OPEN"
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenError("Circuit breaker is open")
                
        try:
            result = function(*args, **kwargs)
            if self.state == "HALF-OPEN":
                self.state = "CLOSED"
                self.failure_count = 0
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.failure_count += 1
            self.last_failure_time = time.time()
            if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
                self.state = "OPEN"
            raise e
```

### 3. Recovery Mechanisms

**Purpose**: Restore system functionality after failures occur

**Key Components**:
- **Retry Strategies**: Intelligent retry mechanisms with backoff and jitter
- **Compensating Transactions**: Reversal of partial operations to maintain consistency
- **Checkpoint and Restore**: State preservation and recovery capabilities
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Alternative execution paths when primary paths fail

**Implementation Patterns**:
```python
def retry_with_backoff(max_retries=3, base_delay=1, jitter=0.1):
    def decorator(func):
        @functools.wraps(func)
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            retries = 0
            while True:
                try:
                    return await func(*args, **kwargs)
                except RetryableError as e:
                    retries += 1
                    if retries > max_retries:
                        raise MaxRetriesExceededError(f"Failed after {max_retries} retries") from e
                    
                    # Calculate delay with exponential backoff and jitter
                    delay = base_delay * (2 ** (retries - 1))
                    delay = delay * (1 + random.uniform(-jitter, jitter))
                    
                    logger.info(f"Retry {retries}/{max_retries} after {delay:.2f}s delay")
                    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

## Distributed Workflow Recovery

Multi-agent workflows present unique recovery challenges due to their distributed nature and long-running operations. The following mechanisms address these challenges:

### Workflow Checkpointing

**Approach**: Regularly save workflow state to enable recovery from the last known good state

**Key Components**:
- **Checkpoint Manager**: Coordinates checkpoint creation and storage
- **Checkpoint Storage**: Durable storage for checkpoint data
- **Checkpoint Selection**: Logic for selecting appropriate checkpoint for recovery

- Ensure checkpoint operations are atomic

### Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions

**Approach**: Implement compensating transactions for each step in a workflow to enable rollback

**Key Components**:
- **Saga Coordinator**: Manages execution of saga steps and compensations
- **Compensation Registry**: Stores compensating actions for each step
- **Saga Log**: Records execution history for recovery
- **Saga Recovery Manager**: Handles recovery of in-progress sagas after failures

**Implementation Example**:
```python
class Saga:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.steps = []
        self.compensations = []
        self.current_step = 0
        self.saga_log = SagaLog(name)
        
    def add_step(self, action, compensation):
        self.steps.append(action)
        self.compensations.append(compensation)
        
    async def execute(self):
        try:
            # Execute each step and record in log
            for i, step in enumerate(self.steps):
                self.current_step = i
                self.saga_log.record_step_start(i)
                await step()
                self.saga_log.record_step_complete(i)
                
            self.saga_log.record_saga_complete()
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            # Failure occurred, execute compensations in reverse order
            self.saga_log.record_saga_failed(self.current_step, str(e))
            await self.compensate()
            return False
            
    async def compensate(self):
        # Execute compensations in reverse order up to the failed step
        for i in range(self.current_step, -1, -1):
            try:
                self.saga_log.record_compensation_start(i)
                await self.compensations[i]()
                self.saga_log.record_compensation_complete(i)
            except Exception as compensation_error:
                # Log compensation failure but continue with other compensations
                self.saga_log.record_compensation_failed(i, str(compensation_error))
```

### Progressive Result Handling
