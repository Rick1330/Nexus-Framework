# Security Model and Sandboxing

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive security model and sandboxing architecture for the Nexus Framework v2.3, addressing the critical need for robust security controls in multi-agent systems with external tool access. While security has been mentioned as a requirement in previous documentation, this architecture provides concrete mechanisms, patterns, and implementation guidelines to ensure system security, data protection, and compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Security Challenges in Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems present unique security challenges that go beyond traditional application security concerns:

1. **Tool Access Vulnerabilities**: Agents with access to external tools could potentially perform unintended or malicious actions
2. **Data Exfiltration Risks**: Agents processing sensitive information could inadvertently leak or expose data
3. **Prompt Injection**: Malicious inputs could manipulate agent behavior through prompt engineering attacks
4. **Model Manipulation**: Attempts to bias or manipulate underlying LLM behavior
5. **Authorization Boundaries**: Complex permission management across multiple agents and tools
6. **Audit Complexity**: Tracking and attributing actions across distributed agent workflows

## Security Architecture Overview

The security architecture is built on six interconnected pillars:

### 1. Threat Modeling Framework

**Purpose**: Systematically identify, assess, and mitigate security threats

**Key Components**:
- **Threat Catalog**: Comprehensive inventory of potential threats to the system
- **Risk Assessment Matrix**: Methodology for evaluating threat likelihood and impact
- **Attack Surface Analysis**: Systematic review of all potential entry points
- **Threat Mitigation Registry**: Mapping of threats to specific mitigations

**Implementation Approach**:
- Adopt STRIDE methodology (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)
- Conduct regular threat modeling sessions for new features
- Maintain living threat model documentation
- Implement automated threat detection where possible

### 2. Agent Sandboxing

**Purpose**: Contain agent execution within controlled environments to limit potential damage

**Key Components**:
- **Execution Environment Isolation**: Separation of agent runtime from host system
- **Resource Constraints**: Strict limits on CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Filesystem Isolation**: Controlled access to file system resources
- **Network Filtering**: Restricted network access based on explicit allowlists

**Implementation Patterns**:
```python
class AgentSandbox:
    def __init__(self, agent_id, security_profile):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.security_profile = security_profile
        self.resource_limits = self._get_resource_limits()
        self.filesystem_access = self._get_filesystem_access()
        self.network_access = self._get_network_access()
        
    def _get_resource_limits(self):
        # Retrieve resource limits based on security profile
        return {
            'cpu_limit': self.security_profile.get('cpu_limit', '0.5'),
            'memory_limit': self.security_profile.get('memory_limit', '512M'),
            'execution_timeout': self.security_profile.get('execution_timeout', 300),
        }
        
    def _get_filesystem_access(self):
        # Retrieve filesystem access rules based on security profile
        return {
            'read_paths': self.security_profile.get('read_paths', []),
            'write_paths': self.security_profile.get('write_paths', []),
            'execute_paths': self.security_profile.get('execute_paths', []),
        }
        
    def _get_network_access(self):
        # Retrieve network access rules based on security profile
        return {
            'allowed_hosts': self.security_profile.get('allowed_hosts', []),
            'allowed_ports': self.security_profile.get('allowed_ports', []),
            'allowed_protocols': self.security_profile.get('allowed_protocols', []),
        }
        
    def execute(self, code, context):
        # Set up sandbox environment
        sandbox = self._create_sandbox_environment()
        
        try:
            # Execute code within sandbox with resource limits
            result = sandbox.run(code, context, 
                                resource_limits=self.resource_limits,
                                filesystem_access=self.filesystem_access,
                                network_access=self.network_access)
            return result
        except SandboxViolationError as e:
            # Log security violation
            security_logger.warning(f"Sandbox violation by agent {self.agent_id}: {str(e)}")
            raise
        finally:
            # Clean up sandbox environment
            sandbox.cleanup()
```

### 3. Permission and Access Control

**Implementation Patterns**:
```python
class CapabilityManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.capability_registry = {}
        
    def register_capability(self, capability_id, description, risk_level):
        self.capability_registry[capability_id] = {
            'description': description,
            'risk_level': risk_level,
            'verification_handler': None
        }
        
    def set_verification_handler(self, capability_id, handler):
        if capability_id in self.capability_registry:
            self.capability_registry[capability_id]['verification_handler'] = handler
            
    def verify_capability(self, agent_id, capability_id, context):
        # Check if agent has the requested capability
        agent_capabilities = self._get_agent_capabilities(agent_id)
        
        if capability_id not in agent_capabilities:
            raise CapabilityDeniedError(f"Agent {agent_id} does not have capability {capability_id}")
            
        # If capability has a verification handler, execute it
        handler = self.capability_registry.get(capability_id, {}).get('verification_handler')
        if handler:
            if not handler(agent_id, context):
                raise CapabilityDeniedError(f"Verification failed for capability {capability_id}")
                
        # Log capability usage
        self._log_capability_usage(agent_id, capability_id, context)
        
        return True
        
    def _get_agent_capabilities(self, agent_id):
        # Retrieve agent's assigned capabilities from storage
        return agent_storage.get_capabilities(agent_id)
        
    def _log_capability_usage(self, agent_id, capability_id, context):
        # Log the usage of a capability for audit purposes
        audit_logger.info(f"Agent {agent_id} used capability {capability_id}", 
                         extra={'context': context, 'timestamp': time.time()})
