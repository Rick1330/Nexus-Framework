# Nexus Framework v2.3: Collaboration Protocols

## Introduction

This document outlines the collaboration protocols for the Nexus Framework v2.3 development team. These protocols establish consistent practices for code management, review processes, and team communication to ensure efficient collaboration and high-quality code delivery.

Following these protocols is essential for maintaining a cohesive codebase, facilitating knowledge sharing, and enabling parallel development across the team. These guidelines reflect industry best practices adapted to the specific needs of developing a sophisticated multi-agent engineering system.

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

Nexus Framework uses a modified GitFlow workflow with the following branch structure:

#### Core Branches

- **`main`**: Production-ready code, always stable
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for feature development
- **`release/*`**: Release candidate branches (e.g., `release/v2.3.0`)

#### Supporting Branches

- **`feature/*`**: Feature development branches (e.g., `feature/memory-vector-store`)
- **`bugfix/*`**: Bug fix branches (e.g., `bugfix/orchestration-race-condition`)
- **`hotfix/*`**: Emergency fixes for production issues (e.g., `hotfix/security-vulnerability`)
- **`docs/*`**: Documentation-only changes (e.g., `docs/api-reference`)
- **`refactor/*`**: Code refactoring without functional changes (e.g., `refactor/agent-interface`)

### Branch Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase and hyphens for branch names
- Include the issue number when applicable
- Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the branch

**Examples**:
- `feature/NX-123-vector-memory-implementation`
- `bugfix/NX-456-fix-orchestration-deadlock`
- `refactor/NX-789-agent-interface-cleanup`

### Branch Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Create branches from the appropriate base branch
   - Features and refactors branch from `develop`
   - Hotfixes branch from `main`
   - Release branches branch from `develop`

2. **Development**: Implement changes in the branch
   - Commit regularly with meaningful commit messages
   - Keep branches focused on a single issue or feature
   - Rebase from the base branch regularly to minimize merge conflicts

3. **Integration**: Merge changes back to the appropriate branch
   - Features and refactors merge to `develop`
   - Hotfixes merge to both `main` and `develop`
   - Release branches merge to `main` and `develop` when finalized

4. **Cleanup**: Delete branches after successful integration
   - Feature branches are deleted after merging to `develop`
   - Release branches are deleted after merging to `main`
   - Hotfix branches are deleted after merging to both `main` and `develop`

### Commit Guidelines

#### Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples**:
```
feat(memory): implement vector storage for semantic memory

Add vector storage implementation for semantic memory using FAISS.
This enables efficient similarity search for memory retrieval.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(orchestration): resolve deadlock in parallel task execution

The orchestrator was not properly releasing locks when tasks failed,
leading to potential deadlocks in parallel execution scenarios.

Fixes #456
```

#### Commit Best Practices

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Separate logical changes into different commits

## Code Review Process

### Pull Request Guidelines

#### Creation

- Create a pull request (PR) when a feature or fix is ready for review
- Use the PR template to provide necessary information
- Link the PR to relevant issues
- Assign appropriate reviewers

   - Request re-review after addressing feedback

5. **Approval and Merge**:
   - PR can be merged after receiving required approvals
   - Squash commits for cleaner history when appropriate
   - Delete the branch after merging

### Code Review Best Practices

#### For Authors

- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized (< 500 lines when possible)
- Provide context and explain complex changes
- Self-review before requesting reviews
- Be responsive to feedback
- Use the PR description to guide reviewers

#### For Reviewers

- Review code promptly (within 1-2 business days)
- Be constructive and respectful in feedback
- Focus on substance over style
