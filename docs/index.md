## Documentation Principles

The Nexus Framework documentation follows these key principles:

1. **Alignment with Code**: Documentation structure mirrors code structure
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Each concept has one authoritative document
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information presented from high-level to detailed
4. **Navigability**: Clear navigation and cross-references between documents
5. **Maintainability**: Documentation is modular and easy to update
