## Overview

The Nexus Framework is a comprehensive, future-proof multi-agent engineering system designed to emulate the internal operations and coordination quality of top-tier engineering organizations like Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Palantir.

This framework represents a complete reimagining of multi-agent orchestration, built from the ground up with elite software engineering principles at its core. It provides a sophisticated, AI-native approach to software engineering that transcends current trends and toolchains.

## Key Components

The framework consists of several modular components:

- **Core Architecture** - The foundational system design with layered components
- **Agent Roles & Protocols** - Specialized agent definitions with clear responsibilities
- **Orchestration & Fallback Mechanisms** - Sophisticated coordination patterns
- **Multi-Domain Engineering** - Comprehensive capabilities across the full stack
- **External Tool Integration** - Seamless integration with specialized tools
- **GitHub Integration & CI/CD** - Professional engineering workflows
- **System Validation** - Rigorous validation methodologies
