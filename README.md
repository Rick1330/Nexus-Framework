## Overview

The Nexus Framework v1.0 is the initial version of a comprehensive multi-agent engineering system designed to emulate the internal operations and coordination quality of top-tier engineering organizations.

This version represents the foundation of the framework, establishing the core architecture and essential components that would later evolve into the more sophisticated v1.1 release.

## Key Components

The framework consists of several core components:

- **System Design** - The foundational architecture and system blueprint
- **Agent Roles** - Definitions of specialized agent responsibilities
- **Orchestration Workflow** - Basic coordination patterns for agent interaction
- **Architecture Documentation** - Comprehensive system documentation

## Documentation

- [System Design](./manus-multi-agent-system.md) - Core system architecture and design
- [Agent Roles](./agents.roles.json) - Agent specializations and responsibilities
- [Orchestration Workflow](./orchestration.workflow.yaml) - Workflow coordination
- [Architecture Documentation](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - Comprehensive documentation
- [Core Principles](./core_principles_synthesis.md) - Foundational principles

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture** - Specialized agents with defined roles
- **GitHub Integration** - Basic integration with GitHub workflows
- **Modular Design** - Component-based architecture for flexibility
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive system documentation

## Implementation

The Nexus Framework v1.0 provides the foundational structure for implementing multi-agent systems in software engineering contexts, with a focus on GitHub integration and collaborative workflows.

## Versioning

- **v1.0** - Initial framework design and architecture (current)
- **v1.1** - Elevated, optimized framework with comprehensive documentation (latest)
