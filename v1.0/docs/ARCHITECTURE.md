# Multi-Manus Agent Engineering Framework: Architecture Documentation

## Introduction

The Multi-Manus Agent Engineering Framework (MMEF) is a comprehensive system designed to emulate a real-world elite software engineering team using multiple Manus agents. This framework orchestrates specialized AI agents in a collaborative workflow that follows professional software engineering discipline, integrates with GitHub, and enables scalable agent-based software development.

This document serves as the primary reference for developers and system designers who want to use, manage, and evolve the MMEF in real-world software engineering projects. It provides detailed explanations of the system architecture, agent roles, orchestration workflows, and integration patterns.

## System Overview

### Purpose and Vision

The MMEF aims to transform software development by creating a scalable, collaborative AI-augmented development model that:

1. Emulates real-world elite engineering team behavior and practices
2. Enables modular, role-based AI workflows with clear responsibilities
3. Integrates deeply with GitHub for professional engineering practices
4. Supports frontend/backend separation, documentation generation, and automated testing
5. Provides integration paths for external tools and services

### Core Architecture

The MMEF architecture consists of five interconnected layers:

1. **Agent Layer**: Specialized Manus agents with defined roles and expertise profiles
2. **Orchestration Layer**: Coordination mechanisms for agent activation and collaboration
3. **Workflow Layer**: Standardized processes for software development lifecycle stages
4. **Integration Layer**: Connections to GitHub and external tools/services
5. **Governance Layer**: Quality control, security, and performance monitoring systems

### Key System Files

The MMEF is defined by three core configuration files:

1. **`manus-multi-agent-system.md`**: The comprehensive system design specification
2. **`agents.roles.json`**: Declarative definition of agent roles and responsibilities
3. **`orchestration.workflow.yaml`**: Detailed workflow pipeline for agent orchestration

## Agent Layer

### Agent Design Philosophy

The Agent Layer is built on the following principles:

1. **Modular Expertise**: Each agent represents a modular unit of expertise with clearly defined capabilities.
2. **Purpose-Driven Design**: Agents have specific purposes that distinguish them from other roles.
3. **Capability Transparency**: Agent capabilities are explicitly documented for clear orchestration.
4. **Activation Mechanisms**: Agents have defined activation triggers that initiate their involvement.
5. **Perspective Elements**: Each agent maintains a characteristic viewpoint for approaching problems.

3. **Verification Relationships**: One agent validates the work of another (e.g., QA Engineer → Developer)
4. **Consultation Relationships**: One agent provides specialized input to another (e.g., Security → Architect)
5. **Specification Relationships**: One agent provides requirements to another (e.g., UX Designer → Developer)

### Extending Agent Roles

To extend the agent system with new roles:

1. Define the new agent in `agents.roles.json` following the existing schema
2. Specify the agent's expertise, responsibilities, inputs, outputs, and activation triggers
3. Define collaboration patterns with existing agents
4. Update the orchestration workflow to include the new agent in relevant workflows

## Orchestration Layer

### Orchestration Philosophy

The Orchestration Layer is designed to:

1. Coordinate agent activities based on events and triggers
2. Manage the sequence and timing of agent activations
3. Facilitate information sharing between agents
4. Handle exceptions and fallbacks when agents encounter issues
5. Provide visibility into the system's operation

### Event Trigger System

The MMEF is primarily event-driven, with workflows initiated by:

1. **GitHub Events**: Repository events, issue events, pull request events, etc.
2. **User Commands**: Direct commands from human orchestrators
3. **Scheduled Events**: Time-based triggers for recurring activities
4. **System Events**: Internal events generated by the MMEF itself

### Workflow Coordination

Workflows are coordinated through:

1. **Step Sequencing**: Defining the order of agent activations
2. **Dependency Management**: Specifying which steps depend on others
3. **Conditional Execution**: Executing steps only when specific conditions are met
4. **Parallel Processing**: Running independent steps concurrently
5. **Error Handling**: Managing failures and retries

### Context Management

The Orchestration Layer maintains context through:

1. **Input/Output Mapping**: Passing outputs from one agent as inputs to another
2. **Shared State**: Maintaining a shared context accessible to all agents
3. **Artifact Storage**: Storing and retrieving artifacts produced during workflows
4. **Historical Context**: Maintaining history of previous agent interactions

### Human Interaction Interface

The MMEF is designed to collaborate with human orchestrators through:

1. **Command Interface**: Accepting direct commands from humans
2. **Review Interface**: Presenting outputs for human review
3. **Intervention Points**: Defining points where human input is required
4. **Observation Mode**: Allowing humans to monitor system operation
